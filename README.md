# The Dye Aggregation Database
The effect of dye-dye interaction on the metal oxide semiconductor surface often results in both blue- (H-aggregate) and red-shifted absorption peaks compared to the monomer. Analyzing the shift in UV/Vis absorption spectra after adsorption forms a convenient way to track aggregation of dyes. We have therefore compiled a data set of over 4000 records that provide an useful reference that researchers can turn to when they want specific information on dye related aggregation.
